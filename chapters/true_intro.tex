Starting point:
Propensitiy score analysis~\cite{Rosenbaum1983}.
Two major branches: PS-weighting and matching.
We study a weighting method.
Procedure: Estimate PS, invert, weight.
Problem: Extreme weights when PS close to 0.
Bias when estimation model is misspecified.
Solution: Balance some measure of dependence simultaneously, e.g.
Covariate balancing PS~\cite{Imai2014a}.
Other solution: Doubly robust estimators\cite{H2005}.
They incorporate treatment and outcome model.
Problem: bad results if either are (slightly) misspecified\cite{Kang2007}.
A third option is obtaining weights (seamingly) unrelated to PS.
Entropy Balancing \cite{Hainmueller2012}, ?balancing\cite{Zubizarreta2015}.
Problem: contstraint $\delta=0$ to strict. Bad convergence.
Solution: relax to $\delta\to 0$ for $N\to\infty$.
Paper with mathematical analysis\cite{Wang2019}. Surprising connection
to PS. Also doubly robust\cite{Zhao2017a}.
This attracted my attention. 

I choose different basis as in \cite{Gyorfi2002}. Does analysis work?
Consistency? Asymptotic Normality? Beyond that?

\cite{Wang2019}: Proofs are substandard. Many mistakes. Missing assumptions. Theorems have to be differently.

This thesis is no erratum of\cite{Wang2019}, but can be consulted for writing one.

We thank Wang and Zubi for discussions.

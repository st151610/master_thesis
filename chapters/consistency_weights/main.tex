The goal of this section is to prove consistency of the optimal solutions to Problem~\ref{bw:1:primal}, that is, of the weights 
$(w^\dagger_i)_{i\le n}$,
for the inverse propensitiy score (see Theorem).
We first show that asymptotically there exists an optimal solution 
$(\rho^\dagger,\lambda^\dagger,\lambda_0^\dagger)$
to Problem~\ref{dual} that converges to the oracle parameter
$
\lambda^*_{\varphi^{'}\circ\,1/\pi}
$
(see Assumption~\ref{asu:basis}.(ii))
in probability (see Theorem).
Dual and primal optimal solutions
$(\rho^\dagger,\lambda^\dagger,\lambda_0^\dagger)$
and
$(w^\dagger_i)_{i\le n}$
are linked through Theorem~\ref{dual_solution_th}.
Thus consistency of the primal solutions follows readily from that of the dual solutions.

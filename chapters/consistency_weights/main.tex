The goal of this section is to establish consistency of the
weights process for the inverse propensity score.
To this end,
we first show that asymptotically there exists an optimal solution 
$
(\rho^\dagger,\lambda^\dagger,\lambda_0^\dagger)
$
to Problem~\ref{dual} that converges to the oracle parameter
\begin{align*}
  (0_N,0,\lambda^*)
  \qquad
  \text{where}
  \qquad
  \lambda^*
  \ 
  :=
  \ 
\left[ 
\varphi^{'} \left( \frac{1}{\pi(X_k)} \right)
\right]_{k\in \left\{ 1,\ldots,N \right\}}
\end{align*}
in probability (see Theorem).
This result justifies Assumption~\ref{asu:feas_dual_sol}.
Furthermore, we will identify the dual solution from Lemma~\ref{lem:meas_dual_sol} 
with the consistent dual solution to derive consistency of the weights process for the inverse propensity score.

The goal of this section is to establish consistency of the
(simplified) weights process $w_0^\dagger$ for the inverse propensity score (see Theorem~\ref{th:max_weight_cons}).
To this end,
we first show that asymptotically there exists an optimal solution 
$
(\rho^\dagger,\lambda^\dagger,\lambda_0^\dagger)
$
to Problem~\ref{dual} that converges to the oracle parameter
\begin{align*}
  (0_N,0,\lambda^*)
  \qquad
  \text{where}
  \qquad
  \lambda^*
  \ 
  :=
  \ 
\left[ 
\varphi^{'} \left( \frac{1}{\pi(X_k)} \right)
\right]_{k\in \left\{ 1,\ldots,N \right\}}
\end{align*}
in probability (see Theorem~\ref{th:cons_dual}).
This result justifies Assumption~\ref{asu:feas_dual_sol} to some extent.
Then, we will identify the dual solution from Lemma~\ref{lem:meas_dual_sol} 
with the consistent dual solution to derive consistency of the (simplified) weights process for the inverse propensity score.
Before we start the analysis we interpose a section on the propensity score function.

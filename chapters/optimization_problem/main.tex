There are different ways
to generate weights for covariate balance.
%
We discussed this in the introduction.
%
Now, we introduce the balancing weights framework of \cite{Wang2019}.
%
It is a (generic) convex optimization problem
that enforces covariate balance by constraints on the search space.
%
Similar to classical propensity score estimates, it only
extracts from the data information about treatment status and individual characteristics.
%
It ignores the outcome.
%
This gives the additional option to balance covariates before observing outcomes.

%
The primary optimization task is to minimize an objective function
over a predefined search space.
%
From a practical point of view, the objective function
instils additional goodness in the weights, 
for example, 
low sample variance \cite[Introduction]{Zubizarreta2015}. 
%
%
More important, however, are the constraints that enforce covariate balance.
%
Both objective function and design of the constraints distinguish the method.
%

After introducing the problem, we shall derive it's dual formulation in the spirit of Theorem~\ref{cv:ts:th}.
This transformation gives us the chance to analyse the initial problem by it's dual problem.
We adopt ideas from \cite{Wang2019} that show how to analyse the dual problem and connect the results to the initial problem.

\section{Dual Problem}
In the previous section we have expounded our choice of $\varphi$ - and with it the objective function of Problem~\ref{bw:1:primal}.
%
Now, we want to apply Theorem~\ref{cv:ts:th} to Problem~\ref{bw:1:primal}.
%
To this end, we provide its proper formulation.

We begin by defining convex sets

\begin{definition}
    A subset $\Omega\subseteq \R^n$ is called CONVEX if we have $\lambda x+(1-\lambda)y\in \Omega$ for all $x,y\in \Omega$ and $\lambda\in (0,1)$. 
  \end{definition}

  Clearly, the line segment $[a,b]:=\left\{ \lambda a+(1-\lambda)b\,\mid \, \lambda\in [0,1] \right\}$   is contained in $\Omega$ for all $a,b\in \Omega$ if and only if $\Omega$ is a convex set.
  
  Next we define convex functions. 
  
  The concept of convex functions is closely related to convex sets.
  
  The line segment between two points on the graph of a convex function lies on or above and does not intersect the graph.

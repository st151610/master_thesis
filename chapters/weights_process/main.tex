In the formulation of Theorem~\ref{dual} we encounter "If (...) there exists the optimal solution $(\rho^\dagger,\lambda_0^\dagger,\lambda)$ ... " .
To be able to study asymptotic properties of the weights, we 
shall assume that Problem~\ref{dual} is feasible,
construct a measurable dual solution, and plug it in $(\varphi^{'})^{-1}$.
Before we formulate concrete assumptions, we provide tools from functional analysis
to obtain measurability. Afterwards, we shall tailor the assumptions to the capability of this tools.

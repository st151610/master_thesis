In the formulation of Theorem~\ref{dual} we encounter "If there exists the optimal solution $(\rho^\dagger,\lambda_0^\dagger,\lambda)$ ... " .
To be able to study asymptotic properties of the weights, we 
shall assume that Problem~\ref{dual} is feasible,
construct a measurable dual solution, and plug it in $(\varphi^{'})^{-1}$.
Before we formulate concrete assumptions, we provide tools from functional analysis
to obtain measurability. Afterwards, we tailor the feasibility assumptions to the capability of this tools.
Then, we interpose a section on basis functions before we construct the weights process - the theoretical analogy of optimal weights.

\section{Basis Functions}
Going back to the functional relationship of optimal dual solution and optimal weights (see Theorem~\ref{dual_solution_th}), we see
that the basis vector of the covariates\index{$B$, vector of basis functions of the covariates}
plays an important role.

Now, we present our choice.

To the best of our knowledge, this is a novelty in the framework of balancing weights.

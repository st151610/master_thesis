In the formulation of Theorem~\ref{dual} we encounter "If (...) there exists the optimal solution $(\rho^\dagger,\lambda_0^\dagger,\lambda)$ ... " .
To be able to study asymptotic properties of the weights, we 
shall assume that Problem~\ref{dual} is feasible,
construct a measurable dual solution, and plug it in $(\varphi^{'})^{-1}$.
Before we formulate concrete assumptions, we provide tools from functional analysis
to obtain measurability. Afterwards, we shall tailor the assumptions to the capability of this tools.

Before we can define the weights process (based on the dual solution), we specify the basis functions.

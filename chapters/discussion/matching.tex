\subsubsection*{Motivation}
The papers \cite{Wang2019,Wang2023} 
are closely related.
In \cite{Wang2019} --- the paper this thesis is based on ---
the authors study weighting methods.
In \cite{Wang2023} the authors propose (in similar style) a matching framework based a constrained convex optimization.
\subsubsection{Conjecture}
The extensions proposed in this thesis (or parts) can be applied to the matching framework of \cite{Wang2023}.
\subsubsection{Ideas/Brainstorming}
The constraints in the problem \cite[(2.1)]{Wang2023} are more complicated. Nevertheless, they rely on the notion of basis function.
While in \cite{Wang2019} the estimation objective is the expectation of potential outcomes, in \cite{Wang2023} it is the average treatment effect.
The structure of the proofs is similar --- first revealing the connection to the inverse propensity score and then employ it in the error analysis of the estimator.

\subsubsection{Motivation}
A very natural idea is to bootstrap from the weighted distribution
$
(w_i\cdot X_i)
$.
I discussed this with Jose Zubizaretta, one of the authors of \cite{Wang2019, Wang2023}.
He told me that testing in practice showed promising results.
To the best of my knowledge the theoretical properties of this particular weighted bootstrap wait to be studied.
\subsubsection{Conjecture}
Results similar to \cite[Theorem~23.5]{Vaart2000} holds for the weighted bootstrap.
\subsubsection{Ideas/Brainstorming}
A good starting point to become familiar with the asymptotic theory of bootstrap is \cite[ยง3.6]{vaart2013} and \cite[ยง23]{Vaart2000}.
For more details, a good starting point could be \cite{Barbe1995}.
The project seems to be challenging - maybe at PHD level.
One could get acquainted with the method of bootstrap by reading the (non-mathematical) introduction \cite{Efron1994}.

\subsubsection{Motivation}
A very natural idea is to bootstrap from the weighted distribution
$
(w_i\cdot X_i)
$.
I discussed this with Jose Zubizaretta, one of the authors of \cite{Wang2019, Wang2023}.
Jose told me that testing in practice showed promising results.
To the best of his and my knowledge the theoretical properties of this particular weighted bootstrap wait to be studied.
\subsubsection{Conjecture}
Results similar to \cite[Theorem~23.5]{Vaart2000} holds for the weighted bootstrap.
\subsubsection{Ideas/Brainstorming}
A good starting point to become familiar with the asymptotic theory of bootstrap is \cite[ยง3.6]{vaart2013} and \cite[ยง23]{Vaart2000}.
For more details, a good starting point could be \cite{Barbe95}.
The project seems to be challenging - maybe at PHD level.
\subsubsection{Organisation}
Understand the mathematical theory of bootstrap.
Talk to Jose Zubizaretta about practical results and possible collaboration.
Develop ideas based on the existing literature.
\subsubsection{Next Step}
Get acquainted with the method of bootstrap by reading the (non-mathematical) introduction \cite{Efron1994}.

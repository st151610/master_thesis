A plethora of applications of the delta method to estimates of the distribution function are to be found in \cite{Vaart2000} and \cite{vaart2013}.
This includes Quantile estimation \cite[ยง21]{Vaart2000}\cite[ยง3.9.21/24]{vaart2013},
survival analysis via Nelson-Aalen and Kaplan-Meier estimator\cite[ยง3.9.19/31]{vaart2013},
Wilcoxon Test~\cite[ยง3.9.4.1]{vaart2013},
and much more.
Maybe Boostrapping from the weighted distribution is also sensible .

\subsubsection{Motivation}
Theorem~\ref{th:main}
immediately allows to apply the functional delta method \cite[§3.9]{vaart2013}, \cite[§20]{Vaart2000}.
This readily generates theoretic results for a large class of plug-in estimators. The plug-in estimators have not been tested before in practice.
\subsubsection{Conjecture}
A large class of plug-in estimators converges in distribution to a nice limiting process.
The estimators work well in practice.
\subsubsection{Ideas/Brainstorming}
A plethora of applications of the delta method to estimates of the distribution function are to be found in \cite{Vaart2000} and \cite{vaart2013}.
This includes Quantile estimation \cite[§21]{Vaart2000}\cite[§3.9.21/24]{vaart2013},
survival analysis via Nelson-Aalen and Kaplan-Meier estimator\cite[§3.9.19/31]{vaart2013},
Wilcoxon Test~\cite[§3.9.4.1]{vaart2013},
and much more.
\subsubsection{Organisation}
Understand the functional delta method.
Determine your interests. Pick an example and compute the limiting process.
If this is fun and successful try another example - or come up with a new plug-in estimator that works with the functional delta method.
Do a simulation study an evaluate the performance of the method in practice.
Start with a plain estimate of the distribution function.
If this works well, plug-in estimators might as well.
Apply the method to real world data.
\subsubsection{Next Step}
Read \cite[§20]{Vaart2000}.

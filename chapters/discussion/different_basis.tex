\subsubsection{Motivation}
The introduction of partitioning estimates~\cite[ยง4]{Gyorfi2002} --- as done in this thesis --- was successful.
Thus the implementation of other local averaging regression techniques, such as kernel estimates~\cite[ยง5]{Gyorfi2002}
is promising. 
\subsubsection{Conjecture}
Similar results as of this thesis hold for basis functions of (boxed) kernel estimates~\cite[ยง5]{Gyorfi2002}.
They have good practical performance.
\subsubsection{Ideas/Brainstorming}
For boxed kernels it is likely easy to prove a lemma similar to Lemma~\ref{lem:basis_2}.
For kernels with unbounded support, such as gaussian kernels, this might be more difficult. 
Generally, the basis functions should approximate treatment and outcome model well (see \cite[Assumptions~1.6 \& 2.3]{Wang2019}).
Partitioning estimates work well in this thesis, because we can define concrete oracle parameters.
If concrete oracle parameters are not readily available, there might be theoretic results to rely on.

Let
$T_i$ be the survival time and $C_i$ the censoring time. indepen.
$X_i$ baseline covariates.
$O_i$ indicator if $(Z_i,\Delta_i)$ are observed.
$Z_i=T_i\land C_i$

$
\Delta_i
=
\mathbf{1}
_
{T_i\le C_i}
$

In our sample 
the first $n$ units have s.
The remaining 
$N-n$ do not have survival times.
We calculate weights for the observed to estimate the distribution of the survival times.
We assume missing at random.

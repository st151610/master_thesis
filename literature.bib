  abstract = {This new edition of The Hitchhiker's Guide has bene?tted from the comments of many individuals, which have resulted in the addition of some new material, and the reorganization of some of the rest. The most obvious change is the creation of a separate Chapter 7 on convex analysis. Parts of this chapter appeared in elsewhere in the second edition, but much of it is new to the third edition. In particular, there is an expanded discussion of support points of convex sets, and a new section on subgradients of convex functions. There is much more material on the special properties of convex sets and functions in ?nite dimensional spaces. There are improvements and additions in almost every chapter. There is more new material than might seem at ?rst glance, thanks to a change in font that - duced the page count about ?ve percent. We owe a huge debt to Valentina Galvani, Daniela Puzzello, and Francesco Rusticci, who were participants in a graduate seminar at Purdue University and whose suggestions led to many improvements, especially in chapters ?ve through eight. We particularly thank Daniela Puzzello for catching uncountably many errors throughout the second edition, and simplifying the statements of several theorems and proofs. In another graduate seminar at Caltech, many improvements and corrections were suggested by Joel Grus, PJ Healy, Kevin Roust, Maggie Penn, and Bryan Rogers.},

  abstract = {The goal of this article is to construct doubly robust (DR) estimators in ignorable missing data and causal inference models. In a missing data model, an estimator is DR if it remains consistent when either (but not necessarily both) a model for the missingness mechanism or a model for the distribution of the complete data is correctly specified. Because with observational data one can never be sure that either a missingness model or a complete data model is correct, perhaps the best that can be hoped for is to find a DR estimator. DR estimators, in contrast to standard likelihood-based or (nonaugmented) inverse probability-weighted estimators, give the analyst two chances, instead of only one, to make a valid inference. In a causal inference model, an estimator is DR if it remains consistent when either a model for the treatment assignment mechanism or a model for the distribution of the counterfactual data is correctly specified. Because with observational data one can never be sure that a model for the treatment assignment mechanism or a model for the counterfactual data is correct, inference based on DR estimators should improve upon previous approaches. Indeed, we present the results of simulation studies which demonstrate that the finite sample performance of DR estimators is as impressive as theory would predict. The proposed method is applied to a cardiovascular clinical trial.},

  abstract = {The estimation of average treatment effects based on observational data is extremely important in practice and has been studied by generations of statisticians under different frameworks. Existing globally efficient estimators require non-parametric estimation of a propensity score function, an outcome regression function or both, but their performance can be poor in practical sample sizes. Without explicitly estimating either functions, we consider a wide class calibration weights constructed to attain an exact three-way balance of the moments of observed covariates among the treated, the control, and the combined group. The wide class includes exponential tilting, empirical likelihood and generalized regression as important special cases, and extends survey calibration estimators to different statistical problems and with important distinctions. Global semiparametric efficiency for the estimation of average treatment effects is established for this general class of calibration estimators. The results show that efficiency can be achieved by solely balancing the covariate distributions without resorting to direct estimation of propensity score or outcome regression function. We also propose a consistent estimator for the efficient asymptotic variance, which does not involve additional functional estimation of either the propensity score or the outcome regression functions. The proposed variance estimator outperforms existing estimators that require a direct approximation of the efficient influence function.},

  abstract = {Covariance estimation becomes challenging in the regime where the number p of variables outstrips the number n of samples available to construct the estimate. One way to circumvent this problem is to assume that the covariance matrix is nearly sparse and to focus on estimating only the significant entries. To analyze this approach, Levina and Vershynin (2011) introduce a formalism called masked covariance estimation, where each entry of the sample covariance estimator is reweighted to reflect an a priori assessment of its importance. This paper provides a short analysis of the masked sample covariance estimator by means of a matrix concentration inequality. The main result applies to general distributions with at least four moments. Specialized to the case of a Gaussian distribution, the theory offers qualitative improvements over earlier work. For example, the new results show that n = O(B log\^2 p) samples suffice to estimate a banded covariance matrix with bandwidth B up to a relative spectral-norm error, in contrast to the sample complexity n = O(B log\^5 p) obtained by Levina and Vershynin.},

The nuisance estimators for the conditional expectation function and the conditional density can be nonparametric or ML methods.

We further provide sufficient low-level conditions for kernel, series, and deep neural networks. We propose a data-driven bandwidth to consistently estimate the optimal bandwidth that minimizes the asymptotic mean squared error. We justify the use of kernel to localize the continuous treatment at a given value by the Gateaux derivative.

Entropy balancing relies on a maximum entropy reweighting scheme that calibrates unit weights so that the reweighted treatment and control group satisfy a potentially large set of prespecified balance conditions that incorporate information about known sample moments. Entropy balancing thereby exactly adjusts inequalities in representation with respect to the first, second, and possibly higher moments of the covariate distributions. These balance improvements can reduce model dependence for the subsequent estimation of treatment effects. The method assures that balance improves on all covariate moments included in the reweighting. It also obviates the need for continual balance checking and iterative searching over propensity score models that may stochastically balance the covariate moments. We demonstrate the use of entropy balancing with Monte Carlo simulations and empirical applications.},

  abstract = {Studying causal effects of continuous exposures is important for gaining a deeper understanding of many interventions, policies, or medications, yet researchers are often left with observational studies for doing so. In the observational setting, confounding is a barrier to estimation of causal effects. Weighting approaches seek to control for confounding by reweighting samples so that confounders are comparable across different values of the exposure, yet for continuous exposures, weighting methods are highly sensitive to model misspecification. In this paper we elucidate the key property that makes weights effective in estimating causal quantities involving continuous exposures. We show that to eliminate confounding, weights should make exposure and confounders independent on the weighted scale. We develop a measure that characterizes the degree to which a set of weights induces such independence. Further, we propose a new model-free method for weight estimation by optimizing our measure. We study the theoretical properties of our measure and our weights, and prove that our weights can explicitly mitigate exposure-confounder dependence. The empirical effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated in a suite of challenging numerical experiments, where we find that our weights are quite robust and work well under a broad range of settings.},

  abstract = {The propensity score plays a central role in a variety of causal inference settings. In particular, matching and weighting methods based on the estimated propensity score have become increasingly common in the analysis of observational data. Despite their popularity and theoretical appeal, the main practical difficulty of these methods is that the propensity score must be estimated. Researchers have found that slight misspecification of the propensity score model can result in substantial bias of estimated treatment effects. We introduce covariate balancing propensity score (CBPS) methodology, which models treatment assignment while optimizing the covariate balance. The CBPS exploits the dual characteristics of the propensity score as a covariate balancing score and the conditional probability of treatment assignment. The estimation of the CBPS is done within the generalized method-of-moments or empirical likelihood framework. We find that the CBPS dramatically improves the poor empirical performance of propensity score matching and weighting methods reported in the literature. We also show that the CBPS can be extended to other important settings, including the estimation of the generalized propensity score for non-binary treatments and the generalization of experimental estimates to a target population.

  abstract = {Many scientific questions require estimating the effects of continuous treatments. Outcome modeling and weighted regression based on the generalized propensity score are the most commonly used methods to evaluate continuous effects. However, these techniques may be sensitive to model misspecification, extreme weights or both. In this paper, we propose Kernel Optimal Orthogonality Weighting (KOOW), a convex optimization-based method, for estimating the effects of continuous treatments. KOOW finds weights that minimize the worst-case penalized functional covariance between the continuous treatment and the confounders. By minimizing this quantity, KOOW successfully provides weights that orthogonalize confounders and the continuous treatment, thus providing optimal covariate balance, while controlling for extreme weights. We valuate its comparative performance in a simulation study. Using data from the Women's Health Initiative observational study, we apply KOOW to evaluate the effect of red meat consumption on blood pressure.},

  abstract = {When outcomes are missing for reasons beyond an investigator's control, there are two different ways to adjust a parameter estimate for covariates that may be related both to the outcome and to missingness. One approach is to model the relationships between the covariates and the outcome and use those relationships to predict the missing values. Another is to model the probabilities of missingness given the covariates and incorporate them into a weighted or stratified estimate. Doubly robust (DR) procedures apply both types of model simultaneously and produce a consistent estimate of the parameter if either of the two models has been correctly specified. In this article, we show that DR estimates can be constructed in many ways. We compare the performance of various DR and non-DR estimates of a population mean in a simulated example where both models are incorrect but neither is grossly misspecified. Methods that use inverse-probabilities as weights, whether they are DR or not, are sensitive to misspecification of the propensity model when some estimated propensities are small. Many DR methods perform better than simple inverse-probability weighting. None of the DR methods we tried, however, improved upon the performance of simple regression-based prediction of the missing values. This study does not represent every missing-data problem that will arise in practice. But it does demonstrate that, in at least some settings, two wrong models are not better than one.},

Inspired by domain adaptation, we show that such methods can be actually reformulated as specific implementations of a discrepancy minimization problem aimed at tackling a shift of distribution from observational to interventional data. More precisely, we introduce a new framework, Covariate Balance via Discrepancy Minimization (CBDM), that provably encompasses most of the existing balancing weight methods and formally extends them to treatments of arbitrary types (e.g., continuous or multivariate). We establish theoretical guarantees for our framework that both offer generalizations of properties known when the treatment is binary, and give a better grasp on what hyperparameters to choose in non-binary settings. Based on such insights, we propose a particular implementation of CBDM for estimating dose-response curves and demonstrate through experiments its competitive performance relative to other existing approaches for continuous treatments.},

This book has firmly established a new and vital area not only for pure mathematics but also for applications to economics and engineering.

In an experiment, one assignment of treatments is chosen and only the values under that assignment can be observed. Bayesian inference for causal effects follows from finding the predictive distribution of the values under the other assignments of treatments. This perspective makes clear the role of mechanisms that sample experimental units, assign treatments and record data. Unless these mechanisms are ignorable (known probabilistic functions of recorded values), the Bayesian must model them in the data analysis and, consequently, confront inferences for causal effects that are sensitive to the specification of the prior distribution of the data. Moreover, not all ignorable mechanisms can yield data from which inferences for causal effects are insensitive to prior specifications. Classical randomized designs stand out as especially appealing assignment mechanisms designed to make inference for causal effects straightforward by limiting the sensitivity of a valid Bayesian analysis.},

Nevertheless, they are often infeasible to conduct for a variety of reasons, such as ethical concerns, excessive expense, or timeliness. Consequently, much of our knowledge of causal effects must come from non-randomized observational studies. This article will advocate the position that observational studies can and should be designed to approximate randomized experiments as closely as possible. In particular, observational studies should be designed using only background information to create subgroups of similar treated and control units, where 'similar' here refers to their distributions of background variables. Of great importance, this activity should be conducted without any access to any outcome data, thereby assuring the objectivity of the design. In many situations, this objective creation of subgroups of similar treated and control units, which are balanced with respect to covariates, can be accomplished using propensity score methods. The theoretical perspective underlying this position will be presented followed by a particular application in the context of the US tobacco litigation. This application uses propensity score methods to create subgroups of treated units (male current smokers) and control units (male never smokers) who are at least as similar with respect to their distributions of observed background characteristics as if they had been randomized. The collection of these subgroups then 'approximate' a randomized block experiment with respect to the observed covariates.},

We try to achieve this by presenting the basic ideas of SVMs together with the latest developments and current research questions in a uni?ed style. In a nutshell, we identify at least three reasons for the success of SVMs: their ability to learn well with only a very small number of free parameters, their robustness against several types of model violations and outliers, and last but not least their computational e?ciency compared with several other methods. Although there are several roots and precursors of SVMs, these methods gained particular momentum during the last 15 years since Vapnik (1995, 1998) published his well-known textbooks on statistical learning theory with aspecialemphasisonsupportvectormachines. Sincethen,the?eldofmachine learninghaswitnessedintenseactivityinthestudyofSVMs,whichhasspread moreandmoretootherdisciplinessuchasstatisticsandmathematics.

We propose a dual coordinate ascent method for this problem that uses inexact line search and either essentially cyclic or Gauss-Southwell order of coordinate relaxation. We show, under very weak conditions, that this method generates a sequence of primal vectors converging to the optimal primal solution. Under an additional regularity assumption, and assuming that the effective domain of the cost function is polyhedral, we show that a related sequence of dual vectors converges in cost to the optimal cost. If the constraint set has an interior point in the effective domain of the cost function, then this sequence of dual vectors is bounded and each of its limit point(s) is an optimal dual solution. When the cost function is strongly convex, we show that the order of coordinate relaxation can become progressively more chaotic. These results significantly improve upon those obtained previously.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces entropy balancing for continuous treatments (EBCT) by extending the original entropy balancing methodology of Hainm\textbackslash "uller (2012). In order to estimate balancing weights, the proposed approach solves a globally convex constrained optimization problem. EBCT weights reliably eradicate Pearson correlations between covariates and the continuous treatment variable. This is the case even when other methods based on the generalized propensity score tend to yield insufficient balance due to strong selection into different treatment intensities. Moreover, the optimization procedure is more successful in avoiding extreme weights attached to a single unit. Extensive Monte-Carlo simulations show that treatment effect estimates using EBCT display similar or lower bias and uniformly lower root mean squared error. These properties make EBCT an attractive method for the evaluation of continuous treatments.},

  abstract = {This book is an introduction to the field of asymptotic statistics. The treatment is both practical and mathematically rigorous. In addition to most of the standard topics of an asymptotics course, including likelihood inference, M-estimation, the theory of asymptotic efficiency, U-statistics, and rank procedures, the book also presents recent research topics such as semiparametric models, the bootstrap, and empirical processes and their applications. The topics are organized from the central idea of approximation by limit experiments, which gives the book one of its unifying themes. This entails mainly the local approximation of the classical i.i.d. set up with smooth parameters by location experiments involving a single, normally distributed observation. Thus, even the standard subjects of asymptotic statistics are presented in a novel way. Suitable as a graduate or Master's level statistics text, this book will also give researchers an overview of research in asymptotic statistics.},

  abstract = {This book tries to do three things. The first goal is to give an exposition of certain modes of stochastic convergence, in particular convergence in distribution. The classical theory of this subject was developed mostly in the 1950s and is well summarized in Billingsley (1968). During the last 15 years, the need for a more general theory allowing random elements that are not Borel measurable has become well established, particularly in developing the theory of empirical processes. Part 1 of the book, Stochastic Convergence, gives an exposition of such a theory following the ideas of J. Hoffmann-J!1Jrgensen and R. M. Dudley. A second goal is to use the weak convergence theory background devel oped in Part 1 to present an account of major components of the modern theory of empirical processes indexed by classes of sets and functions. The weak convergence theory developed in Part 1 is important for this, simply because the empirical processes studied in Part 2, Empirical Processes, are naturally viewed as taking values in nonseparable Banach spaces, even in the most elementary cases, and are typically not Borel measurable. Much of the theory presented in Part 2 has previously been scattered in the journal literature and has, as a result, been accessible only to a relatively small number of specialists. In view of the importance of this theory for statis tics, we hope that the presentation given here will make this theory more accessible to statisticians as well as to probabilists interested in statistical applications.},

  abstract = {Weighted estimators are commonly used for estimating exposure effects in observational settings to establish causal relations. These estimators have a long history of development when the exposure of interest is binary and where the weights are typically functions of an estimated propensity score. Recent developments in optimization-based estimators for constructing weights in binary exposure settings, such as those based on entropy balancing, have shown more promise in estimating treatment effects than those methods that focus on the direct estimation of the propensity score using likelihood-based methods. This paper explores recent developments of entropy balancing methods to continuous exposure settings and the estimation of population dose-response curves using nonparametric estimation combined with entropy balancing weights, focusing on factors that would be important to applied researchers in medical or health services research. The methods developed here are applied to data from a study assessing the effect of non-randomized components of an evidence-based substance use treatment program on emotional and substance use clinical outcomes.},

  abstract = {Weighting methods are widely used to adjust for covariates in observational studies, sample surveys, and regression settings. In this paper, we study a class of recently proposed weighting methods which find the weights of minimum dispersion that approximately balance the covariates. We call these weights "minimal weights" and study them under a common optimization framework. The key observation is the connection between approximate covariate balance and shrinkage estimation of the propensity score. This connection leads to both theoretical and practical developments. From a theoretical standpoint, we characterize the asymptotic properties of minimal weights and show that, under standard smoothness conditions on the propensity score function, minimal weights are consistent estimates of the true inverse probability weights. Also, we show that the resulting weighting estimator is consistent, asymptotically normal, and semiparametrically efficient. From a practical standpoint, we present a finite sample oracle inequality that bounds the loss incurred by balancing more functions of the covariates than strictly needed. This inequality shows that minimal weights implicitly bound the number of active covariate balance constraints. We finally provide a tuning algorithm for choosing the degree of approximate balance in minimal weights. We conclude the paper with four empirical studies that suggest approximate balance is preferable to exact balance, especially when there is limited overlap in covariate distributions. In these studies, we show that the root mean squared error of the weighting estimator can be reduced by as much as a half with approximate balance.},

  abstract = {Community detection is a fundamental problem in network analysis, with applications in many diverse areas. The stochastic block model is a common tool for model-based community detection, and asymptotic tools for checking consistency of community detection under the block model have been recently developed. However, the block model is limited by its assumption that all nodes within a community are stochastically equivalent, and provides a poor fit to networks with hubs or highly varying node degrees within communities, which are common in practice. The degree-corrected stochastic block model was proposed to address this shortcoming and allows variation in node degrees within a community while preserving the overall block community structure. In this paper we establish general theory for checking consistency of community detection under the degree-corrected stochastic block model and compare several community detection criteria under both the standard and the degree-corrected models. We show which criteria are consistent under which models and constraints, as well as compare their relative performance in practice. We find that methods based on the degree-corrected block model, which includes the standard block model as a special case, are consistent under a wider class of models and that modularity-type methods require parameter constraints for consistency, whereas likelihood-based methods do not. On the other hand, in practice, the degree correction involves estimating many more parameters, and empirically we find it is only worth doing if the node degrees within communities are indeed highly variable. We illustrate the methods on simulated networks and on a network of political blogs.},

Recently, there is an emerging interest in directly incorporating covariate balance in the estimation. We study a recently proposed entropy maximization method called Entropy Balancing (EB), which exactly matches the covariate moments for the different experimental groups in its optimization problem. We show EB is doubly robust with respect to linear outcome regression and logistic propensity score regression, and it reaches the asymptotic semiparametric variance bound when both regressions are correctly specified. This is surprising to us because there is no attempt to model the outcome or the treatment assignment in the original proposal of EB. Our theoretical results and simulations suggest that EB is a very appealing alternative to the conventional weighting estimators that estimate the propensity score by maximum likelihood.},

  abstract = {Weighting methods that adjust for observed covariates, such as inverse probability weighting, are widely used for causal inference and estimation with incomplete outcome data. Part of the appeal of such methods is that one set of weights can be used to estimate a range of treatment effects based on different outcomes, or a variety of population means for several variables. However, this appeal can be diminished in practice by the instability of the estimated weights and by the difficulty of adequately adjusting for observed covariates in some settings. To address these limitations, this paper presents a new weighting method that finds the weights of minimum variance that adjust or balance the empirical distribution of the observed covariates up to levels prespecified by the researcher. This method allows the researcher to balance very precisely the means of the observed covariates and other features of their marginal and joint distributions, such as variances and correlations and also, for example, the quantiles of interactions of pairs and triples of observed covariates, thus balancing entire two- and three-way marginals. Since the weighting method is based on a well-defined convex optimization problem, duality theory provides insight into the behavior of the variance of the optimal weights in relation to the level of covariate balance adjustment, answering the question, how much does tightening a balance constraint increases the variance of the weights? Also, the weighting method runs in polynomial time so relatively large data sets can be handled quickly. An implementation of the method is provided in the new package sbw for R. This paper shows some theoretical properties of the resulting weights and illustrates their use by analyzing both a data set from the 2010 Chilean earthquake and a simulated example.},
